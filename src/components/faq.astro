    question: "Will my idea remain confidential with Bloorsoft?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We respect your intellectual property rights and the trust you place in us.

  },
  {
    question:
      "Can I have an expert review your architecture plans before full development begins?",
    answer:
      "Certainly. If you wish to validate our architectural approach, we're open to working with a fractional CTO or an external consultant of your choosing to review our plans. This step ensures that you feel confident in our work's quality and integrity before moving forward. We're committed to building a solution that's not just robust but also aligns with industry best practices and your long-term vision.",
  },
  {
