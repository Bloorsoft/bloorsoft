title: "Help Refugee - Helping Those Who Need It Most"
snippet: "Immigration is hard. Building software is also hard (not as much). But having detailed and easy-to-understand documentation can make both of these things a bit easier. That's why we are building Help Refugee, a platform that helps Canadian refugees find the information they need to start a new life."
