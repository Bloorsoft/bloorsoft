# Bloorsoft ü§ù Streamline Climate

## Introduction

At Bloorsoft, we pride ourselves on our ability to deliver high-quality custom software solutions tailored to the unique needs of startups. When Streamline Climate, a San Francisco-based, VC-backed company that builds software to help businesses find and apply for grants 5x faster, approached us with a time-sensitive project, we were ready to take on the challenge.

## The Challenge

Streamline Climate needed a custom integration with Microsoft Sharepoint/OneDrive that would allow their users to upload files directly from OneDrive to their platform. This feature was crucial for one of Streamline Climate's biggest clients, and the project had to be completed within a tight 3-week timeline.

## Our Approach

Our team at Bloorsoft quickly dove into Streamline Climate's codebase to understand the existing infrastructure and project requirements. We then designed and implemented a custom component that enabled users to easily select files from their OneDrive accounts and seamlessly add them to the Streamline Climate platform.

#### Frontend Development

On the frontend, we created an intuitive user interface that guided users through the process of finding and selecting files from their OneDrive accounts. Our team ensured that the component was visually appealing, user-friendly, and consistent with Streamline Climate's existing design language.

#### Backend Integration

Behind the scenes, our fullstack developers worked diligently to establish a secure and efficient connection between the Streamline Climate platform and Microsoft Sharepoint/OneDrive. We implemented the necessary APIs and data pipelines to ensure that files selected by users were smoothly transferred and stored within Streamline Climate's data system.

#### Testing and Deployment

With the clock ticking, our team conducted thorough testing to ensure that the OneDrive integration functioned flawlessly and met all of Streamline Climate's requirements. We then worked closely with their team to deploy the new feature to production, ensuring a smooth rollout to their users.

## The Result

Despite the challenging timeline, Bloorsoft delivered the custom Microsoft Sharepoint/OneDrive integration for Streamline Climate in less than 3 weeks. Our ability to quickly understand their codebase, implement the necessary components, and deploy the feature allowed Streamline Climate to meet the needs of one of their biggest clients and further solidify their position as a leader in the grant application software space.
