# TeleVU Innovation ü§ù Bloorsoft

## Introduction

At Bloorsoft, we're passionate about helping startups bring their innovative ideas to life through custom software development. When TeleVU Innovation approached us with their vision for a comprehensive TelePresence Ecosystem for healthcare professionals, we were thrilled to join forces and make it a reality.

## The Journey

Our journey with TeleVU Innovation began in 2023, and over the course of a year, we worked hand in hand to develop a suite of cutting-edge solutions that would reshape the way healthcare providers interact with technology and, ultimately, improve patient care.

#### Augmented Reality Integration

One of the key projects we undertook was the integration of augmented reality into healthcare. Our team of experts built a full-stack software system using React, Node, Prisma, and SCSS, creating a seamless experience for users. We also implemented a scalable microservice architecture and optimized the database to ensure smooth performance, even as TeleVU Innovation's platform grew.

#### iSee Web Application UI

Another exciting challenge was developing a modern, user-friendly interface for TeleVU's iSee Web Application. We wanted to create a Zoom-like experience that would enable specialists to easily communicate with responders wearing AR glasses. By focusing on intuitive design and seamless functionality, we helped streamline telemedicine processes and enhance the overall user experience.

#### BioVU Mobile App Integration

But our work didn't stop there. We also integrated TeleVU's in-home patient care device with their React Native mobile application, BioVU. This required our team to dive deep into cutting-edge technologies like React's Bluetooth Low Energy library, developing unique modules to enable smooth connectivity. The result was a powerful tool that empowered patients to receive top-quality care from the comfort of their homes.

#### Custom Chat Microservice

To further enhance communication capabilities across the TeleVU application suite, we implemented a custom chat microservice using Express, Node.js, and Socket.IO. By leveraging TeleVU's existing AWS architecture, we were able to seamlessly integrate this new feature, providing users with even more ways to connect and collaborate.

## Exceeding Expectations

Throughout our partnership, we were committed to not just meeting but exceeding expectations. Whenever challenges arose, our team proactively sought out solutions, ensuring that we delivered exceptional functionality and performance without compromising timeline or budget.

## The Impact
The impact of our work with TeleVU Innovation was significant. During our collaboration, they secured numerous deals with hospitals across Canada for their iSee and uSee platforms. By rapidly developing features requested by potential customers, we played a crucial role in helping TeleVU Innovation grow and succeed.
