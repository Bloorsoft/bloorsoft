        Bloorsoft is actively looking for talent. We're based in Toronto & SF. We offer flexible work hours + remote positions. However, we'd love to work with you in person.
      </p>
      <p>
        We care a lot about the work that we do. It sounds clichÃ©, but we are not a typical software agency. Bottom line (profit) optimization is not our main goal. We want to build great products that people love. We want to work with clients who share our values.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested to join our team, send us an email at <a href="mailto:admin@bloorsoft.com" class="text-indigo-600">admin@bloorsoft.com</a> with your resume and a brief introduction about yourself. Please share your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        We look forward to hearing from you! ðŸš€
