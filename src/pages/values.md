- Build high-quality, efficient software, as fast as possible
- Be transparent and honest in all our dealings
- Be a place that values people -- although we are a technology company, we are a people company first
- Be true to ourselves and our clients -- if we don't think your project has any potential, we will not just take your money, we will tell you
