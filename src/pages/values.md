This is a collection of values that guide us in our business and in our software development. It is not exhaustive, but it is a collection of values that guide us in our business and in our software development.

## How we run our business

- Be transparent and honest in all our dealings
- Be a place that values people -- although we are a technology company, we are a people company first
- Be true to ourselves and our clients -- if we don't think your project has any potential, we will not just take your money, we will tell you

## How we build software

- We believe in the Camptsite Rule of software engineering -- "When possible, leave code better than you found it"
- Iteration is key -- we don't build software in one go, we iterate fast, get feedback and improve
